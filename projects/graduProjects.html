    <h1>Graduation System</h1>
    <div class="projectContent">
        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>When I was in university, I found out many students liked working alone on their graduation projects at home and only coming back to university to meet their supervisors or submitting their papers. Therefore, I decided to chose a graduation project for being-graduated students, namely: Graduation Project Management System (GPMS) in order to help them with their projects and save them time. The GPMS targeted at professors and students, helping with them in choosing projects and handing in papers, etc. The GPMS can give both of them great convenience during the time for graduation projects.
        </p>
        <h5>Process</h5>
        <p>At the beginning, I wrote a proposal and discussed it with my supervisor, Prof. Zhenlian Shi. And I asked which features the system could include and how to implement it. I outlined some sketches to help me express my idea and a conspicuous timeline was showed in every page. My supervisor was impressed by the idea, so I started to design the interface subsequently.</p>
        <p>Setting up a website and running it on HTML and CSS were easy. Back-end programming, however, was the greatest challenge. Thanks to the project of OA system we had finished in September in which I had gained some experiences about programming with Java and SQL. So I could continually learn from it and figured out the solution and conquered this challenge.</p>
        <p>I was very interested in design, so I paid more attention on the details of interface and interaction, e.g. every button had different looks when users' pointer hover it, lots of input boxes had grey hint in the boxes and plenty of mini icons to help users to learn how to use quickly. As a result, my project was seen as pretty and user friendly.</p>
