        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>Raago is an iOS app that I worked on at eDaoyou. It is an app helping people search stores that worthy of visiting in a massive big shopping mall in Beijing.</p>
        <h5>Process</h5>
        <p>As a start-up company, we need to create a user friendly and useful app that could attract loyalty users. After many times of brainstorms, we finally figured out a simple but excellent app, which could extend easily. As a result, Raago was turned out.</p>
        <h5>My Role</h5>
        <p>Used storyboards, sketches, wireframes and prototypes, I was responsible for the interaction design & UX design of Raago. It took me some days to be familiar with design principle of mobile apps because I didn't have sufficient experience in mobile app development. You'll see some sketches I draw blow.</p>
        <p>The graphic design of Raago's admin panel was also my responsibility. Because it was a chance for me to practice my skill of graphic design. Moreover, none of our graphic designers had time to work on it at that time, I thereby undertook this duty.</p>
