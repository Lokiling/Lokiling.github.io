            <p>Passionate about traveling and exploring, I chose travel as the focus of my capstone project. However, travel can be a super broad topic. People have their own preference about traveling: some enjoy nature, some love exploring cities, some get inspired by exotic foods, some are into experience different cultures, others are just want to have sometime to be totally relaxed…</p>
            <p>In this project, I first talked with people about travel in general and make decision about what should I do, who should I design for, etc… I, then, planned and did some field researches while I traveling in Finland and Italy after IXDA 2016. Finally, with all the researches I have done, I started ideation and made wireframes and prototypes.</p></div>

                <p>Travel is a big and complex topic. It always involves at least three phases: preparing before a trip, exploring during a trip and sharing and recalling after a trip. Moreover, people have their own perspectives when it comes to travel. You will get different answers if you talk with a bunch of people about what they think travel is. </p>

<p>Collecting exemplars and interviewing people who love traveling helped me to know what I could and wanted to do for my project. Collecting exemplars is a good way to get insights, explore more possibilities within the topic and also to check what other products have done for travelers. Talking with people, on the other hand, helped me narrowing down the scope and getting ideas and insights from other travelers’ perspectives. </p>

<p>As I found that there are too many apps and websites aiming at preparing a travel and sharing story after a travel while I was collecting exemplars, I decided to focus on designing a tool to help people while they are actually traveling. From the interviews with travelers, I narrowed my scope even further to just focus on traveling in cities. </p>

                <div class="sectionTextColumns">
                <p>As I mentioned before, people have different lens about traveling. Narrowed the topic to traveling in cities didn’t specific enough for a design project. As a designer, I know I cannot design for everyone: people have different needs, different perspectives, etc. So I needed to focus on a particular type of travelers. </p>
<p>I am a solo backpacker who love exploring cities and I choose to stay in hostels so I can meet other travelers. Thanks for that, I have met a bunch of travelers share the same or similar ideas as I do.  In general, we love exploring cities by foot, simply because we can get a chance to feel the real cities, to see how people live there or even to have a conversation with locals. I called this type of traveler explorer. Relaxing and enjoying are not the priority goal of our journey. As an explorer, we love to experience the locals’ feeling, we eager to discover those secret, beautiful and unique places and we enjoy to share our stories with fellow travelers </p>
<p>I thought the travelers that I met are a good resources for my project and I found few apps of websites aiming at explorers, so I made a decision that I would focus on explorers while they discovering cities.</p>

One of the biggest challenge for my project is not to take away this exciting and rewarding feeling if explorers use my design to find hidden spots. </p>
                <p>My concept is an mobile app that using real-time location to help explorers discover and share hidden gems in cities. To not ruin the exciting moments, I designed this “game” after I explored many ideas. The app will let users know when there is a hidden gem around them while they exploring in a city. Users can see a few brief reviews about the place and decide whether they want to check it or not. If they do, the “hunting game” will start. By using their phone’s GPS and gyroscope, the app guides the user by pointing to the location but not specifically telling them where the hidden spot is exactly. In this case, explorers still need to explore the area to discover the wonderful places and feel a sense of achievement after they found the place. Explorers can also write reviews about hidden gems that found and even share new ones that not yet exist in the app. I shared my concept and paper prototypes with my traveler friends and they loved the idea. </p>

                <h5>Constraints, Communication & Wireframing</h5>
                <p>This project was not about fancy ideas with wearable technologies. We needed to embrace the constraints: it has to be a checklist and we need to consider the limited funding from the police department. But like others said: If there were no constraints, it's not design. It's art or fantasy. As designers, we should leverage limitations to explore more possibilities.</p>

<p>Sketching is great for exploring ideas and concepts really quick. Wireframing, on the other hand, can be an effective way to find out those tiny details that we could easily forget when we sketching. Sometimes doing wireframe could also found a design flaw that we never thought about before, and would change our design significantly. Start doing basic wireframe is a good way to validate concepts. </p>

<p>Communication always plays a big role in the design process. We need to keep everyone on the same page and really need to make sure of it. I see communication is a key skill for designers. And it not just about communicate with other designers, but also including communicate with other people in a company, like engineers, sale team, etc.</p>
