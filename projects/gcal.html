        <div class="cardContent projectOverview">This is a one week academic project to design a new experience of the week view of Google Calendar. We have two limitations in this project: cannot add/delete elements and change colors, unless we have a strong reason to do so. Because this is a one-week project, I redesigned it just based on the feedbacks I collected from people who I interviewed.</div>

                <h5>Left Side Bar</h5>
                <p class="sectionTextLeft">Most of the elements in the left side bar of current design are not important features nor used frequently. They do, however, occupy a lot of spaces in this page and may distract users.</p>
                <p class="sectionTextLeft">Google Calendar users, who I interviewed, merely use the mini-calendar and they don't frequently toggle nor edit their different calendars.</p>
                <p class="sectionTextLeft">Base on <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/horizontal-attention-leans-left/" target="_blank">Horizontal Attention Leans Left</a>, People spent more than twice as much time looking at the left side of the page as they did the right.</p>

                    <p>The Control Bar is more frequently-used than the features in Left Side bar. Such as switching between week view and month view, or jumping to next week/month, etc.</p><br/>
                    <p>However, when users focusing on calendar, their mouse pointer, most of time, are hovering around the middle of the calendar area. In this case, The control bar is seems a little bit far away and not very easy to reach.</p>

                <h5>Minimize distractions</h5>
                <p class="sectionTextLeft">I shrunk the size of side bar, so it’ll be more spaces for the calendar per se and less distractions than current design.</p>
                <p class="sectionTextLeft">The mini calendar and the names of each calendar are hidden in Sidebar. Users can still click on the Hamburger icon to expand the sidebar to see them.</p>
                <p class="sectionTextLeft">As most of calendars are created by users themselves and because they using them a lot to create different events, the colors of each calendar should be enough for them to recall. Beside, users can still toggle each calendars without expand the side bar by click the colored squares, which present different calendars.</p>
                <p class="sectionTextLeft">I also moved most of the functions in Control bar into left sidebar to release more spaces for calendar and also to reduce the length users have to move their pointer to reach these buttons.</p>
