        <div class="cardContent projectOverview">
            <p>When Google released Material design back in Google I/O 14, I was very intrigued by the idea of having a design language that can help a product scale, keep the design consistent from both visual and behavioral aspects. Since then, I started to grow interest in design systems. </p>
            <p>When I joined GuideSpark in late 2016, the company had changed its positioning to software. We had a small design team, and we had a long list of features that we wanted to pump into our product. The design for the product matured with time. However, the fast-growing rate of developing features left many inconsistencies in GSCC.</p>
            <p>To help with this issue, I suggested establishing a design system in GuideSpark that includes components and provide guidelines. However, the journey was not simple, nor easy.</p>

        <div class="alignTitleCards">
            <p class="textNoCard">After a couple of years of fast-growing, GuideSpark Communicate Cloud shined with features. However, design and dev debts had accumulated that causing problems casting shadows on our product.</p>

                <h5>Inconsistency</h5>
                <div class="sectionTextColumns">
                    <p>Consistent design patterns help users to learn how to use a product easier, better predict the behaviors and overall better usability. It can also build up users' trust and loyalty toward the product.</p> 
                    <p>However, each time we had a new feature, the design might be shifted a little. On the other hand, engineers sometimes implement the same UI pattern in different ways. This caused our UI patterns to have different looks and behaviors.</p>
                    <p>For example, we changed the style of buttons to be bolder and bigger. However, buttons from old features are still using the old style. Another example is colors: we found more than 70 different greys exist in our product, from an audit I did with engineers.</p>

                    <p>Most of the common UI patterns were done by copying & pasting existing codes to "reuse".  After a couple of years of this, it was extremely hard to maintain our codebase. Updating style or behavior would take weeks since it would require engineers to update all existing instances of that component. The engineering team spent a lot of time refactoring, which slowed down our progress.</p>

                <h5>Button</h5>
<!--
                <p>As one of the most common design patterns, Button was the first component we built into our product. After I studied from a few popular design guidelines, including Material design, Atlassian Design, and Polaris from Shopify, I built a design component for the button in Figma. I made sure that the Button component has a similar look and feel that can fit into our existing product. I also built prototypes with HTML & CSS to show how each different state looks like, and how the transitions should be. Later, I wrote design documentation for the Button and shared it with the design team and the engineering team. </p>
                <p>I worked closely with engineers to ensure the implementation of the button component is flexible, aligned to our design component in Figma, and easy to reuse. Our engineers loved how easy it is to use this component and that kicked off a good start. </p>
-->
                <p>As one of the most common design patterns, Button was the first component we built into our product. By the time we decided to componentize it, our front-end team planned to refactor part their code and built react components to solve their own inconsistency problem. It was good timing since we were working on a feature that involves buttons.</p>

            <img src="../images/dsys/buttons.png" class="centerPic">

                <h7>Research & study</h7>
                <p>Learn from the best. I studied from a few popular design guidelines, including Material Design, Atlassian Design, and Polaris from Shopify.</p>
                <h7>Build design component in Figma</h7>
                <p>After audited all existing buttons, I worked in Figma to build the Button component. I made sure it has a similar look and feel to the rest of our product so it can fit into it and won’t cause obvious visual inconsistency. </p>
                <h7>Test the concept with HTML&CSS</h7>
                <p>It’s hard to get a sense of the transition of each state in a static design file. So I built prototypes with HTML & CSS check and improve the details of each state and the transition between them. This also helped me varify whether the concept was solid and realistic.</p>
                <h7>Share component with designers</h7>
                <p>After some testing, I published the button component and shared it with other designers. We held component meetings regularly to inform updates and get feedback, so everyone can contribute.</p>
                <p>The code was shared with engineers who worked on the React component, so they can easily transfer the visual to React & Sass.</p>
                <h7>Documentation</h7>
                <p>I wrote a design document for the Button component on Confluence, includes the different types of the button and when to use them, behaviors and states, design specs, props, and more.</p>
                <p>This document is shared across design, product and engineer teams, so open to comments.</p>
                <h7>Implementation</h7>
                <p>I worked closely with engineers to ensure the implementation of the button component is flexible, aligned to our design component in Figma, and easy to reuse. The engineers and I had a few working sessions so that I could help to spot any visual inaccuracy.</p>
                <p>Our engineers loved how easy it is to use this component and that kicked off a good start</p>
                <h7>One-offs and iterations</h7>
                <p>Moving forward, we had a few one-off situations that the design didn’t fit our existing component. In those cases, designers tried to see if they could make design changes so we could reuse the component. If not, I would work with engineers to check whether we should incorporate it into our component. </p>

Next, we will make UI and UX changes to the components to better suit the needs of our product, and give a fresh look for our brand.</p>
                <p>The engineering team created a separate repo for importing and modifying those components. Later on, when the new components are tested, we will merge these new components into the production so the engineering team can leverage the component across teams.</p>
