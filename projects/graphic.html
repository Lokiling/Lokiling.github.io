    <h1>Portfolio Redesign 2013</h1>
    <div class="projectContent">
        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>I love painting since I was very little. Although graphic design is not going to be my engaged career, I really enjoy the process when designing or drawing something out of the image in my mind.</p> 
        <p>There're a part of my works of Graphic Design I have done recently, including my portfolio redesign, the back-end system of Raago, etc.</p>
        <h5>Logo Design</h5>
        <div id="camera_wrap1" class="camera_wrap">
            <div data-src="images/graphic/logo.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/loadingGIF.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/logoSubline.jpg"></div>
        </div>
        <p>When I began to redesign the logo of my website, I started with drawing some cartoon figures on my notebook. After a few times of tries, I started to draw a figure of fox, which is one of my favorite animals, and suddenly I realized that the shape of the fox I was drawing was in a shape of 'M', which is the initiate of my first name.So I took a little more time to carefully restructure the fox perfectly representing the letter of M and with a beautiful tail, which I also took time to carefully design.</p>
        <p>Pictures above is the final design and the process of graphic designing.</p>
        <h5>Portfolio Redesign</h5>
        <div id="camera_wrap2" class="camera_wrap">
            <div data-src="images/graphic/projectView.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/projectGrids.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/worksDetail.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/worksPre.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/loct.jpg"></div>
        </div>
        <p>The process of redesign, which I was really enjoying about, took me more than a month to complete. I took all my energies on designing appearance and streamlining experience. There are some original creations.</p>
        <h5>Raago Dashborad</h5>
        <div id="camera_wrap3" class="camera_wrap">
            <div data-src="images/graphic/dashboard.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/dashboard_create.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/dashboard_edit.jpg"></div>
            <div data-src="images/graphic/dashboardCal.jpg"></div>
        </div>
        <p>I am now working in a startup company which focuses on mobile apps and "Raago" is one of the products I am currently working on. You can get more info about it in its page of "Detail" (Not available, but coming soon).</p>
        <p>Although I am a product manager & interaction designer in this company, I undertake the duties on the graphic design works of "Raago" in terms of Dashborad after wireframing, due largely to the short of designers (startup company, you know :D ).</p>
