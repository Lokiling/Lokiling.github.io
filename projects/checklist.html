        <div class="cardContent projectOverview">This is an one-week project for Agency360. The project is to design a responsive checklist web app for patrol officers focusing on helping them to do their day-to-day job. The checklist should create an efficient way for police officers to remember what to do on certain calls, and for supervisors to be able to see that call procedure was handled correctly. </div>

                <p>If you try to search "To do list", you will get hundreds of different products that aiming to help people getting organized or remember to-dos. However, a normal checklist app may not works efficiently for patrol officers, due to most of the actions are highly conditional. Plus, reading through a list full of irrelevant items may even oblious their process.</p>
                <p>After our interview with Officer Teter and designers from Agency360 during our class, our team started framing the problems that our design can solve and brainstorming ideas and concepts. We thought these features that could be included in the checklist app might be helpful for patrol officers with their routine calls: </p>

                    <p class="miniPicContent">Based on our interviews with Police Officers in Bloomington, we found that patrol officers always overwork and barely get positive feedback from their supervisors. Their jobs can be stressful. Moreover, police officers' jobs can extremely affects their family life.</p>

The supervisor can send a thank note back to the officer if he/she did a great job. The officer will receive this feedback after his/her current case.

            <div class="cardContent">
                <h5>Constraints, Communication & Wireframing</h5>
                <p>This project was not about fancy ideas with wearable technologies. We needed to embrace the constraints: it has to be a checklist and we need to consider the limited funding from the police department. But like others said: If there were no constraints, it's not design. It's art or fantasy. As designers, we should leverage limitations to explore more possibilities.</p>

<p>Sketching is great for exploring ideas and concepts really quick. Wireframing, on the other hand, can be an effective way to find out those tiny details that we could easily forget when we sketching. Sometimes doing wireframe could also found a design flaw that we never thought about before, and would change our design significantly. Start doing basic wireframe is a good way to validate concepts. </p>

<p>Communication always plays a big role in the design process. We need to keep everyone on the same page and really need to make sure of it. I see communication is a key skill for designers. And it not just about communicate with other designers, but also including communicate with other people in a company, like engineers, sale team, etc.</p>
