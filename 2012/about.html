        	<p class="font">I achieved my bachelor degree in Software Engineering at <a href="http://www.bjut.edu.cn/" class="link" target="_blank">Beijing University of Technology</a> in 2011. I got an intern, as a designer of a project, in <a href="http://www.chinasofti.com/superWebCMS/pages/sites/MainSite/html/en/index.shtml" class="link" target="_blank">ChinaSoft International</a> at the beginning of my senior year. After that, I found my dream is to be an interaction designer. I was lucky enough to spend one and a half years at <a href="http://www.happyelements.com/" class="link" target="_blank">Happy Elements</a>, a famous social game company in China, after I graduated. As a product manager, I participated in development of two games. Most of my jobs in Happy Elements were data analysis, sketching, designing user interface and interaction. </p>

			<p class="font">I'm a Google Fan and I think most of Google's products are remarkable. The designs of their products are simpler and easier to use after their latest update. Moreover, Google's products actually do ease people's lives. </p>
			<p class="font">Now, my passion about human-centered design drives me towards pursuing a master degree in Human-Computer Interaction	in	U.S. I expect I can create fantastic things to enrich and facilitate people's lives in the future.</p>
